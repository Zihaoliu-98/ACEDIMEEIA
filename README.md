Please enjoy the interesting (hopefully so) reports with preferably a cup of Weissbier and a large piece of Schweinshaxe/Eisbein.

Even if you feel it very difficult to chew and swallow the "dry content" of the documentations...

Well...please give some patience to read everything until the end. Trust me, it's gonna worth the efforts. 

At least you will feel the haxe and the bier being the best ever in your life XD

In Chinese, we have a proverb, which translates to english "if you want to hunt two rabbits simultaneously, you will not get any one of the two". We could have also dumped several naive ideas without developing, but this is not how engineers handle the things.

Anyway, have a nice day my friend.

Auf Wiedersehen
