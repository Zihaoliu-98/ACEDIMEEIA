# AECDIMEEIA

As the old tale said, the brightest peak is the dirtiest place.

WE as a team have participated the 2019 challenge led by office of information and communications technology of the United Nations (UN), which is co-led by Egypt and UK government and is supported by UNDP.

we thought UN is really doing things seriously, but the fact is, we are wrong.

They are just a bunch of bureaucratic idiots and assholes.

Almost everyone is misjudged. They said they require a working prototype, but at the end, those who did nothing were ranked almost the highest.

They said that our solutions are not user-friendly. FUCK YOU dumbass! We provided a screen to directly see what's going on, but what you want is a fucking APP???? That's more friendly???

They asked us to provide documentations, and also said we have lots of problems to solve. GO FUCK YOUSELF. We wrote the solution and everything in our documentation. If you don't read it at all, you definitely know nothing about it.

Do you know what's fucking hilarious？The judge reviewed 18 fucking ideas in ine single day！？And said, "your idea is good, but it doesn't solve climate change." WHAT?? You asked for something to deliver information, but now you expect us to be superman to solve the fucking climate change? WE ARE NOT DONALD TRUMP IDIOTS!

They are biased in their judgements, giving the ideas whose owner is of the same nationality/ethinicity with them. They criticise every other ideas, giving 1 or 2, but ranking the one they chose as 5. Why the hell do these retards think it is not obvious?

They don't even pretend to be giving fair judgement tbh. We did the solution on embedded system, the other people did it as well but used a phone app. So the judges said that the winning ideas is extremely user friendly by using a phone app, and said that your ideas are not because you ised a phone app. WTTTTTTTFFFFFFF?

They know nothing about real technologies, while claiming that their goal is to find a communication and information tool. STUPID HYPOCRITES.

We reported this to the judges themselves and their boss in charge, but they don't care at all, and they even asked us to respect the "consensus of judges". Respect those mentally handicapped dumbass who asked us to solve climate change?You know what, it is like flying over polar region with only HF--I WOULD RATHER ASK A MONKEY TO DO IT RATHER THAN YOU FOOLS!

Therefore, we decided to put them on this "hall of fame" to let later folks who feel like to further work on this competition to know what the fuck they actually are.

The judges are: Benjamin Larroquette, Kriti Sharma
The person in charge: Francesco Delpriore

Hope you rest in peace, as I cannot see any mental capabilities for you to propely live on this planet in the near future.

My fellow brothers, trust me. STAY AWAY FROM UN AND SUCH BUREAUCRATIC ORGANIZATIONS.

Have some Weissbier and a nice Schweinshaxe. That's the proper way of live.
